   * This is the constructor for the {@link TrainDeparture} class. It initializes an object of
   * {@link TrainDeparture}. The constructor takes the following parameters:
   *
   * @param departureTime The time of departure. The time is a {@link LocalTime} object in the
   *                     format HH:MM, it is not set as final because it can be changed if there is
   *                     delay. If a departure is set to 08:30 it will disappear from the
   *                    {@link UserInterface} after 08:30, also after the delay has passed.
   *                     <p>This depends on what current time is given from the user.
   *                     The parameter is set as a {@link LocalTime} object so that it can be
   *                     calculated correctly, in example: 11:55 + 10 minutes = 12:05, not 11:65.
   *                     </p>
   * @param line The line the train will go. Several trains can go on the same {@code line}, but
   *            obviously not at the same time. The line is given as a final String in the format
   *            "L1", "L2", "L3" and so on. It will be displayed accordingly in the
   *            {@link UserInterface}.<p>This parameter is set as a String because it contains both
   *            letters and numbers,and will not be needed for further mathematical calculations.
   *             </p>
   * @param trainNumber The {@code train number} is a unique number for each train. The train number
   *                    is given as an Integer. The number is unique within a 24-hour period.<p>
   *                    The {@code train number} is set as a final Integer because it will not be
   *                    changed, and the number will only contain Natural(N) numbers.</p>
   * @param destination The final {@code destination} for the train. The {@code destination} is
   *                    given as a String, and is displayed accordingly.<p>Setting the parameter as
   *                    a final String is most appropriate because it is a word. For example, a
   *                    train departure from Trondheim to Oslo, has Oslo as its final
   *                    {@code destination}, and this will not change.</p>
   * @param track The {@code track} the train will depart from. The {@code track} is given as an
   *             Integer because it is a one-digit number. <p>It is not set as a final parameter
   *             because not all trains have a {@code track}, in these cases the track is set to -1,
   *             and it can be changed, or set, later with a mutator method.</p>
   * @param delay The {@code delay} for the departure. The {@code delay} is given as an Integer,
   *             since the {@code delay} time only contains Natural(N) numbers. The delay is
   *             usually not longer than a few minutes, therefore it is given in the format M
   *             (how many minutes), not HH:MM,like the {@code departure time}. If there is no
   *             {@code delay}, it will not be displayed. If there is a {@code delay}, it will
   *             <p>Not all trains have a delay, or the delay will come later, therefore it is
   *             not a final Integer, and it can be changed, or set, later with a mutator method.
   *             </p> The {@code delay} will be displayed as HH:MM in the {@link UserInterface}
   *             within the {@code departure time}.
