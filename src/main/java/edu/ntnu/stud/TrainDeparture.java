/**
 * This class represents one specific train departure.
 * A train departure has a departure time, a line, a train number, a destination, a track and possibly a delay.
 *
 * The constructor takes the following parameters, and initializes an object of the type TrainDeparture.
 * @param departureTime The time of departure. The time is given as an Integer in the format HHMM.
 *                      For example 08:30 is given as 0830. In the user-interface the time is displayed as hh:mm.
 *                      If a departure is set to 08:30, it will disappear from the user-interface after 08:30, and also after the delay has passed.
 *                      This depends on what current time is given from the user.
 * @param line The line the train will "drive". Several trains can go on the same line, but obviously not at the same time.
 *             The line is given as a String in the format "L1", "L2", "L3" and so on. And it will be displayed accordingly in the user-interface.
 * @param trainNumber The train number is a unique number for each train. The train number is given as an Integer.
 *                    The number is unique within a 24-hour period.
 * @param destination The final destination for the train. The destination is given as a String, and is displayed accordingly.
 *                    For example a train departure from Trondheim to Oslo, has Oslo as its destination.
 * @param track The track the train will depart from. The track is given as an Integer. Not all trains have a track,
 *             in these cases the track is set to -1.
 * @param delay The possible delay for the departure. The delay is given as an Integer in the format HHMM.
 *              If there is no delay, it will not be displayed, and it is set to 0000. If there is a delay, it will be displayed as hh:mm.
