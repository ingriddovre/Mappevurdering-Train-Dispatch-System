  /**
   * This is the constructor for the TrainDeparture class. It initializes an object of the type
   * TrainDeparture. The constructor takes the following parameters:


   * @param departureTime The time of departure. The time is given as an Integer in the format HHMM,
   *                     it is not set as final because it can be changed if there is delay.
   *                     The time can only contain Natural(N) numbers, therefore it is given as an
   *                     Integer. For example 08:30 is given as 0830.
   *                     In the user-interface the time is displayed as hh:mm. If a departure is set
   *                     to 08:30, it will disappear from the user-interface after 08:30,
   *                     also after the delay has passed. This depends on what current time is given
   *                     from the user.

   * @param line The line the train will go. Several trains can go on the same line, but obviously
   *            not at the same time. The line is given as a final String in the format "L1", "L2",
   *            "L3" and so on. And it will be displayed accordingly in the user-interface.
   *            This attribute is set as a String because it contains both letters and numbers,
   *            and will not be needed for further mathematical calculations.

   * @param trainNumber The train number is a unique number for each train. The train number is
   *                    given as an Integer. The number is unique within a 24-hour period.
   *                    The train number is set as a final Integer because it will not be changed,
   *                    and the number will only contain Natural(N) numbers.

   * @param destination The final destination for the train. The destination is given as a String,
   *                    and is displayed accordingly. Setting the destinations attribute as a final
   *                    String is most appropriate because it is only a word. For example a train
   *                    departure from Trondheim to Oslo, has Oslo as its destination,
   *                    and this will not change.

   * @param track The track the train will depart from. The track is given as an Integer because it
   *             is a one-digit number. It is not set as a final attribute because not all trains
   *             have a track, in these cases the track is set to -1, and it can be changed, or set,
   *             later with a mutator method.

   * @param delay The delay for the departure. The delay is given as an Integer, since the delay
   *             time only contains Natural(N) numbers. The delay is usually not longer than a few
   *             minutes, therefore it is given in the format M (how many minutes), not HHMM,
   *             like the departure time. If there is no delay, it will not be displayed, and it is
   *             set to 0000. If there is a delay, it will be displayed as hh:mm in the
   *             user-interface. Not all trains have a delay, or the delay will come later,
   *             therefore it is not a final Integer, and it can be changed, or set, later with a
   *             mutator method.

   * @throws DateTimeException Is thrown if the departure time is not between 00:00 and 23:59.
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the line is empty, the train number is less than 0,
   *        the track is less than -1 or if the delay is not between 0 and 59.
   * @throws NullPointerException if the destination is empty.
